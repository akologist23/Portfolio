Porfolio

Hello! And welcome to my portfolio containing samples of data analysis, 
data science, data visualization, and academic research, notably using the R programming language.
Check out my first-authored published papers for writing samples and 
data visuals (e.g., scatterplots, ArcGIS maps, conceptual models). I provide both 
code and a presentation for a machine learning project
I completed to predict late flights coming from three NYC airports. 

Thanks for stopping by!
